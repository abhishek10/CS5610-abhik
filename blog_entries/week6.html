<h3>Designed clock using javascript and canvas </h3>

<p>
   This is like small aplication where I developed Clock using Canvas and javascript. </br>
   I tried to use whatever I learned in my previous experiment on javascript to construct something </br>
   at application level. All experiments shows sequential order of how I achieved the running clock </br>
   starting from single circle.
