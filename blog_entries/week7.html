<h3>Worked with Maps </h3>

<p>
    This week I worked with Maps using libraries from arcgis.com. I learned how I can use map apis to locate the location.</br>
    Also added toolbar to perfoem different operation on map like drawing line from one location to another. I think</br>
    I can use this things in my project if I decide to do some project which uses locations / Maps like finding nearest </br>
    hospital, Hotel or Resturant.
