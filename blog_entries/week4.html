<h3>Worked on JQuery </h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on JQuery and worked on different small experiments which uses JQuery. </br>
    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal </br>
	and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across </br>
	a multitude of browsers.</br>
