<h3>Worked on java scripts </h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on java scripts and worked on different types of events
    for which we can use java scripts. </br>I worked on events like button click, on load, when click on link
    and other such events. Using javascript </br> we can peroform all kind of client side validations
    on user inputed data before sending it to the server,  </br>reducing chances of sending incorrect data to server. It saves
    lot of network resources and time. </br>
    I performed different experiments to learn this things like - </br>
    1. Bouncing ball on button click event </br>
    2. Celsius and Fahrenheit conversion </br>
    3. Automatic clock on pageload event and other things </br>
