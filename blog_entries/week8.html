<h3>Worked with Scalable Vector Graphics and Project Idea </h3>

<p>
    This week I worked with Scalable Vector Graphics. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector </br>
	image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification </br>
	is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. SVG drawings can be dynamic and interactive.</br></br>
    I also started looking at free APIs which I can use for my project. I found some APIs and I worked on those APIs.</br>
	I also Created application key for using that API and took permission from API providing company that I am going to </br>
	use it for Academic purpose only. I need to discuss the project idea with the Professor. So next week I will meet </br>
	Professor to get his approval.	</br>
    .
