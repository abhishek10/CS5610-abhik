<h3>Worked on AngularJS </h3>

<p>
    HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring </br>
    dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. </br>
    The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</br>
    This week I worked on AngularJS and worked on different small experiments which uses AngularJS. </br>
