<h3>Worked with External Web APIs and Project Idea </h3>

<p>
    This week I worked with external web APIs. I tried calling some external web APIs to get data of my interest. </br>
	For that I used eventful API which provides the information about the event occurring in California San-Diego.</br>
	Data response of that API is in JSON format. Then I parsed that JSON data to get useeful information about that event.</br>
	Also I called this external Web API through java script and parsing is also done using the java script only</br>
	I am going to use same idea for my project where user can search for any event occurring all over the world</br>
