    This week I worked on environment setup and created homepage. 
    I also added tabs like 'Experiment', 'Documentation' and </br>
    'Project' on my homepage and tried few experiments
    with html and css for this first week. </br>

    1. How to use different html tags </br>
    2. How to use css to make html page look better and reducing lot of 
       duplicate code for styling by using same css for</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different pages and 
       sections on same page. </br>
