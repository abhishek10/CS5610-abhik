<h3>Worked on project and experiments related to it </h3>

<p>
    In this week, I worked on my project idea and implemented the core idea of the project. Actually I implemented </br>
	few things related to this project in last week only but it was not concrete. In this week I implemented searching </br>
	of events all over the world using eventful API. Right now user can only provide location and type of event for searching events. </br>
	I am planning to provide date of the event in the search criteria so that user can find the events specified in particular </br>
	dates. Also next week I am targeting to create login page and user can see other users profile, What kind of events they like </br>
	and which event they are planning to go. I have already started working on this idea and writing some sample code in my project </br>
	but its not in working state as of now. I hope, I can improve the quality of this application in next two weeks.
