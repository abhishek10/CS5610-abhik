        The home page is the first page that user can see when he clicks on my project. I have tried to create it attractive 
        so that the user feels like entering the website. I have used slideshow effect which is achieved using CSS3 and Javascript. I have
        played with opacity and also used an interval of time as to when to switch to another image. The homepage also includes
        navigation menu through which user can avail all the functionalities provided by website.

        A snapshot of the Home Page is as follows:</p><br/>
        <img class="image" src="../../images/Project_snapshots/Project_home.png"/><br/><br/>
