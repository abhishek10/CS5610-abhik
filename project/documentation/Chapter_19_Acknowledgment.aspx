        I would like to thank Professor Rasala for guiding me through the course and the project. The best thing about his lectures 
        is he knows what is important and how much a student should know about it, and so accordingly he divides his time frame. 
        The experiments that he puts up and the variety he offers by trying out various things is very helpful. A very useful resource 
        that I used to solve my technical doubts and refer to was Prof. Rasala's Website. All minute details of the technology are 
        explained very clearly on his site and it helped me through most of the things on my project.<br/><br/>
        I am also thankful to Professor Jose who took a lecture on JSON. That lecture really helped me to understand about Yelp API
        in detail as it was based on JSON. I really liked his way of teaching which was so lucid. He is always there to help! Loads 
        of thanks to him too!<br/><br/>
        All of the MS assistants were like mentors to us and guided us through every single week of the projects. Their sites were an
        excellent example for all of us. I thank all of them for putting in their time and efforts.<br/><br/>
        Special thanks to  Yitao Xiong who was extremely helpful and always guided me by giving constructive feedback every week. 
        His website is something that I really look up to. The neat and clean CSS on his site is something that catches immediate 
        attention.<br/><br/>
        Lastly, I would like to thank Yelp.com and google.com for providing their respective API's without which my website has no
        use. The documentation provided by both the websites for their API was very clear and easy to understand.<br/><br/>
        I assure to all the people that this is not the end of development of this website. I will keep it updated and keep on 
        modifying it. I want to add all the proposed enhancements into this website, so that it will be useful in my future and career.
