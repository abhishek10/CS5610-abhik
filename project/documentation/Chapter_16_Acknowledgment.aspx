                    I would like to thank you Professor Jose Annunziato for taking this course. I am sure that this course will help me 
                    in my future career a lot. In the first lecture only Professor explained how now days coding 
                    is shifted from backend server to front end in order to increase the response time and efficiency. I am very happy that
                    I got an opportunity to learn  latest technologies like mongodb, JQuery, Ajax, javascript, ASP.NET, C#.NET, angular.js,
                    node.js and many more. I would also like to thank TA of this course Rishi Katyal for evaluating my website  periodically
                    and providing me good suggestion about my experiments and work which helped me alot to learn new things. I would also like
                    to thank you Professor Rasala for clearing my doubts on piazza and his website helped a lot to to get breakthrough for
                    my SQL server connection issue.  I will keep this website updated and keep on modifying it. I will make sure that I add
                    all new stack of new features to my project which I could not do because of limited time.
